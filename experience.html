<h3 align="center">3 Days 2 Nights in Vietnam</h3>
<p align="justify">This is a story about my experience traveling in Vietnam. This trip was held by my aunty’s company. Her boss will plan a trip once a year. There were eight people including myself. My aunt offered me to join the trip. This is my first time going overseas. It is also my first time riding an airplane. I feel nervous and excited at the same time. We depart from the company around 12 am – 1 am. We arrived at KLIA airport around 3 am – 4 am and we wait for our flight. I cannot remember the exact time because this trip was on. The flight takes around two hours to arrive at Vietnam Airlines.</p>

<h3 align="center">Tran Quoc Pagoda & Temple of Literature</h3>
<p align="justify">The first stop that we go to is the temple. The tour guide brought us to the temple. It is unique. It is my first time visiting a temple close. The structure and design of the building are really beautiful. The tour guide gives an explanation to us about the temple. During our trip, to the Tran Quoc Pagoda, we saw a lot of teenagers may be from high school or college. They are drawing the building structure and design. It is maybe for their project.</p>

<h3 align="center">Hanoi</h3>
<p align="justify">Next, we go to Hanoi. First, we go to the hotel to put our stuff and go to the restroom and rest a little bit. After that, the tour guide brought us around the place and give us a try of Vietnamese food. It was my first time eating on the street. I do not take any pictures because I was too busy eating XD. This is an example of the picture. It looks exactly like this.</p>

<p align="justify">Road and traffic in Vietnam are really scary. There are too many motorbikes and cars and the same time. We are scared to cross the road but gladly the tour guide helps us well. Below is the picture how the traffic looks like.</p>

<p align="justify">Heading back to the hotel, we stop at a restaurant for dinner, and then after that, we go to the hotel to get a rest and have some sleep.</p>

<h3>Syrena Cruise</h3>
<p align="justify">On the next day, we woke up early in the morning to go on the cruise. We bring all of our stuff because we are going to sleep on the cruise. The company rents a cruise named Syrena Cruise. It is a 4-star traditional Vietnamese wooden boat departing from Tuan Chau port for the most popular route of Halong Bay. The inside of the cruise is very beautiful and luxurious. The crew was also very polite, helpful, and knowledgeable. The food cooked by chefs is amazing. I cannot forget how is it taste. This is also my first time riding a cruise and sleeping on a cruise. It is an amazing experience for me. It is all my first time's experience. On the cruise, we are shown how to make a prawn spring roll by the chef. My aunt gets to try how to make it.</p>

<h3>Ha Long Bay & Hang Luan</h3>
<p align="justify">The cruise takes us to Ha Long Bay. We get to see a beautiful sea and mountains. The environment was peaceful. It is a good time to release stress. After taking us around the Ha Long Bay and making us enjoy the view, they make a stop and we need to get to using a smaller boat to get into Hang Luan Cave. In the cave, we get to see wild monkeys. We are told not to get near them or give food to them. There are many other travelers from other cruises too. The view of the cave is really beautiful. We actually can choose a package where we want to go there using kayak or just tell the local to bring there.</p>

<h3>Sung Sot Caves</h3>
<p align="justify">At the next stop, we go to the Sung Sot Caves. It is also near Ha Long Bay. We got inside the cave. It is really beautiful with all the light prepared. It looks unique. Besides that, at the cave, we can also use the stairs to get to the top to see the view of Ha Long Bay. Elderly and people with leg pain are not suggested because the stairs are many and long. I get exhausted when I arrived at the top. We go back to the cruise and have some rest and sleep.</p>

<h3>Last Day</h3>
<p align="justify">We go back to Hanoi using the cruise. For the last day, we went shopping such as clothes, keychains and more to bring back to Malaysia as a memory. I do not remember what time did we get on the plane. What I remember is we arrived in Malaysia around 11 pm or 12 am.</p>
<p align="justify">This is the most memorable memory that I had. I had many pictures of the trip but lost many of them. I only find a few of them.</p>
